0.02  11/2/2000

    - XML config file.  Among other things, this allows _all_ configuration to be
      done at runtime.  Multiple configurations can be used at the same time (for
      things like syncing one LDAP server with another).
    - dn construction is now configurable
    - support for "calculated" fields.  As in ldap-abook wherein "cn=givenname .
      lastname", etc...
    - Added LDIF backend
    - Added more backend functions.  The backends now support the following:
      - LDAP: add, delete, update, search
      - LDIF: add, read, reset, truncate
      - Text: add
      - DBI: search, add, truncate
      - HTML: show 
    - Internally, I moved all knowledge of the field name translations to the Entry
      object.  Instead of backend having to do forward and reverse field name
      lookups in the configuration hashes, now they can request an attribute hash
      with the appropriate key names from the Entry object.  In other words,
      $entry->get(db=>LDAP) returns a hash whose keys are those defined for the
      LDAP backend.  This ended up making backend functions much easier to write &
      debug.
